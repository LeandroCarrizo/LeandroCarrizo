I am Leandro, a Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience in machine learning development and data analysis, with knowledge of Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Docker, and deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch, as well as applications in NLP and computer vision.

ðŸ“ŒMy career in data science is complemented by my experience as a civil engineer. Over the course of more than 6 years, I worked at the LEMIT laboratory, conducting scientific research. During that time, I collaborated in interdisciplinary teams and acquired skills to statistically analyze data obtained in practice. I have published more than 10 articles in specialized journals, focusing on topics related to recycled concrete and sustainability.

ðŸ“ŒI am a highly motivated individual, constantly seeking opportunities to acquire new skills and take on fresh challenges. If you are looking for someone passionate about data analysis, machine learning, and AI, and committed to continuous learning and development, please feel free to contact me at leandrocarrizo1@gmail.com.
